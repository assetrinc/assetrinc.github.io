# Installation

The recommended method for installing assetrinc is via Composer.  If you are not familiar with Composer, check out the [Composer documentation](http://getcomposer.org).

Assetrinc's package name is `assetrinc/assetrinc`.

It is highly recommended that you require a specific version of assetrinc in your composer.json for now.  That is, do not include `0.0.*` or `~0.0.6`, but instead include `0.0.6`.  Assetrinc is still undergoing research and development, so backwards incompatible changes are still likely to occur between versions.
